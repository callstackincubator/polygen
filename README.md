# Polygen

Polygen is a library for React Native that allows you to run WebAssembly modules in your apps, statically, without interpreting.

## Getting started

> [!WARNING]
> This library is still under active development. Feel free to hack around, but use at your own risk.

## How it works?

Instead of interpreting the WebAssembly modules, or doing Just-in-Time compilation, Polygen instead leverages the Ahead-of-Time compilation.
This solution can be used in iOS applications and other Apple devices, where JIT compilation is not allowed,
without impacting performance.

It uses the wonderful [`wasm2c`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/main/wasm2c) tool to generate C code from every `WebAssembly` module.
Then, additional React Native/JSI glue native code is generated that allows to call the generated C code from JavaScript.

This gives us the ability to run WebAssembly modules in a statically compiled way, without the need for JIT compilation.

## Requirements

- React Native 0.75+

## Prerequisites

Because Polygen Codegen depends on [`wasm2c`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) tool, you need to have it installed on your machine.
You can install it by either:

1. Downloading precompiled binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/releases) of wabt project.
2. Building it from the source:

   ```sh
   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt
   $ cd wabt
   $ git submodule update --init
   $ cmake -B build -S .
   $ cmake --build build
   ```

Then, you need to make binaries visible to polygen tool. You can do this in two ways:

- Set the `WABT_PATH` environment variable to the directory with binaries (`wabt/build` if you built it from source):

  ```sh
  # assumes build from source path
  $ export WABT_PATH=$(pwd)/build
  ```

- Append the `PATH` environment variable to the directory with binaries (`wabt/build` if you built it from source):

  ```sh
  # assumes build from source path
  $ export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/build"
  ```

## Installation

In your React Native project run:

```sh
npx @callstack/polygen init
# or
yarn dlx @callstack/polygen init
```

## Usage

In your application folder run:

```sh
## npm
npx polygen scan
# apply changes in config
npx polygen generate

## yarn
yarn polygen scan
# apply changes in config
yarn polygen generate
```

Run `polygen scan` to search for changes in found WebModules. All modules must be explictly listed in `polygen.config.[mc]js`
Run `polygen generate` after any of the WebAssembly module changed.

To use WebAssembly API, import `@callstack/polygen/polyfill` in your application (before any other imports):

```js
import '@callstack/polygen/polyfill';
```

### Metro

Polygen has a Metro plugin that allows you to import WebAssembly modules in your application.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, only modules from the current package are supported. This will be implemented in the next version.

Add `@callstack/polygen-metro-config` dependency to your project:

```sh
yarn add -D @callstack/polygen-metro-config
```

Then, in your `metro.config.js` file, add the following:

```js
const { withPolygenConfig } = require('@callstack/polygen-metro-config');
```

And wrap your Metro configuration with `withPolygenConfig` call:

```js
const config = {
  // ...
};

module.exports = withPolygenConfig(
  mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config)
);
```

Then, you should be able to import module buffers in your application:

```js
import example from '../table_test.wasm';

const instance = new WebAssembly.Instance(new WebAssembly.Module(example));
```

### Using Fetch

You can also pass WebAssembly module binary loaded using `fetch`, or any other method:

```js
await WebAssembly.compileStreaming(
  fetch('http://localhost:8000/example.wasm')
)
```

The downloaded module is not actually executed, but a native counterpart is searched based on the module checksum.

This does not require any additional setup, but it has the overhead of fetching the module on runtime, just for it to
be discarded.

For it to work, you need:

 - Place exactly the same WebAssembly Module in `src` directory of your application.
 - The module binary checksums must match

## Examples

See `apps` directory for usage examples.
