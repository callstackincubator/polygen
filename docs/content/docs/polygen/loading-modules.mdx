## Loading a module

Now that we have added a module in the project, we can load it in the JavaScript code.

There are two ways to load a module in Polygen:

 - **Fetch** - load the module using `fetch` API, compatible with WebAPI
 - **Bundler integration** - load the module using the bundler, e.g. Metro

## Fetch

<Callout type="warn">
  This approach is supported only for migration and compatibility reasons, it is sub-optimal and should not be used in production.
</Callout>

Polygen provides support for loading WebAssembly modules using the [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API),
which is a part of widely supported WebAPI.

As you may remember from the [Introduction](/docs/polygen/intro), Polygen does not allow loading arbitrary modules at runtime,
so how does this work?

Rather than loading the module from the network and running it, Polygen instead loads the module only to compute its unique fingerprint (hash),
and then uses this fingerprint to find the correct module in the project.

If the module with matching hash was not added, an error is thrown.

<Callout type="info">
Fetching a module only to compute its hash is wasteful and can be a source of issues. We suggest you to use bundler integration instead.
</Callout>

This approach still requires [Adding the module](/docs/polygen/first-module) to the project, but allows you to use code that works on the Web platform
without changes.

Let's consider an example:

```ts title="example.ts"
// Assuming localhost:8000 server is running and serving the `example.wasm`
await WebAssembly.compileStreaming(
  fetch('http://localhost:8000/example.wasm')
)
```

The code above only compiles when the same module was added to the project, and the application was compiled with it.

## Bundler integration

Polygen provides a way to load WebAssembly modules using the bundler, e.g. Metro.

This approach is the recommended way to load modules in Polygen, as it is more efficient and does not perform any additional network requests,
and instead refers to WebAssembly module statically.

When using bundler integration, you can import the module just as you would do with any other module. The imported JavaScript value is
a special reference to the module, which can be passed to `WebAssembly.Module` constructor.

```ts title="example.ts"
import myWASMModule from './modules/example.wasm';

const module = new WebAssembly.Module(myWASMModule);
```

To setup up bundler integration, follow the documentation specific to the bundler:
