This article compares Polygen to other approaches for running WebAssembly modules in React Native applications.

## React Native WebAssembly

This allows you to run WebAssembly modules in React Native applications, using the same approach as in Web applications.

Instead of precompiling the modules, React Native WebAssembly uses `wasm3` runtime, which interprets the modules during execution.

The approach does not impose any additional limitations on module execution, but it is slower than precompiled modules.
With this approach you can use WebAssembly modules that are not supported by Polygen, but you will lose the performance benefits.

    'No limitations on module execution',

  cons={[
    'Performance overhead',

## TurboModules

This approach does not really run WebAssembly modules, but instead requires you to write a native module in C++ and use them in React Native applications.

<ProsConsOverview
  pros={[
    'Possibly the highest performance',
    'Not limited by WebAssembly limitations (e.g. threading)',
  ]}
  cons={[
    'Requires writing a TurboModule adapter',
    'Requires long-term maintenance of the native code',
  ]}
/>
