## Introduction

Polygen is a toolkit that allows you to run WebAssembly modules directly in your React Native application, with near native performance.

You can use WebAssembly just like you do in Web applications - using widely supported and standard WebAPI, but with the added benefit of running it natively on your device.
This approach provides a way to share codebase between Web and Native applications, when using WebAssembly.

## Why?

WebAssembly <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(WASM)</span> allows us to create highly-reusable, high performance modules that can be written in multiple languages.

At it's core, it is a virtual machine with a set of low-level instructions, which is designed to be fast and efficient. Modules are platform independent,
therefore a single module can be run on different CPU architectures without a need to distrubute precompiled modules for all platforms.

It specifies no standard library nor runtime, making it ideal for embedding in other environments, such as React Native.

Each module is sandboxed, and has no access to the system or other modules, unless the Embedder (you) allows it to. This provides
a very high level of security and isolation.

## How it works?

Before going in-detail on how Polygen works, let's first understand how WebAssembly works in a browser environment.

### WebAssembly in Browser
Browsers come with a dedicated Runtime for WebAssembly, which is separate from JavaScript runtime.
Usually, when working with WebAssembly in browser environment, you need to perform some steps to execute the module:

 1. Load WebAssembly module (e.g. using `fetch` API)
 2. Compile the module (this steps essentialy decodes binary module into executable code)
 3. Create an instance of the module (this step creates an instance of the module, which can be used to call exported functions)*

The browser can either interpret the WebAssembly module, or compile it using Just-in-Time compilation (during second step).

<Callout type='info'>
Last two instructions can be streamlined using `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` API, which combines compilation and instantiation into a single step.
</Callout>

So, for example the following code will load and run a WebAssembly module:

```ts
const binaryModule = fetch(`path/to/module.wasm`);
const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(binaryModule);

console.log('Result:', instance.exports.add(1, 2));
```

### WebAssembly in React Native

While we could do exactly the same in React Native, such approach would make it slow and too taxing on mobile devices.

Instead of interpreting or performing Just-in-Time compilation, Polygen instead performs Ahead-of-time compilation
of WebAssembly modules into C/C++ code using the wonderful [`wasm2c`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/main/wasm2c/README.md) tool.
After that, Polygen generates additional glue code so that the compiled WebAssembly module can be used from JavaScript code.

Generated C/C++ code becomes part of your application binary, just like other native libraries.

Because there's no Just-in-time compilation, applications using Polygen can be released in the Apple ecosystem,
where JIT compilation is prohibited.

## Limitations

Polygen approach provides the highest performance, but also comes with a set of tradeoffs you must be aware of:

 - You cannot load WebAssembly modules dynamically at runtime
 - You need to compile the module ahead of time
 - You need to maintain an allowlist/whitelist of WebAssembly modules

<Callout type='info'>
In the future Polygen may support various strategies of WASM execution, including JIT compilation, making above limitations less strict.
