## Installing WABT

As already mentioned in the previous chapter, Polygen uses `wasm2c` tool to compile WebAssembly modules into C/C++ code.
Therefore, you need to have `wasm2c` tool, which is a part of WebAssembly Binary Toolkit (WABT) installed on your system.

### Binary installation

The easiest way to install `wabt` toolkit is to use a system's package manager to download
the prebuild binary.

You can do this using the following command(s):

<Tabs groupId="system" persist items={['Mac', 'Linux', 'Windows']}>

  <Tab value="Mac">

    WABT is available in homebrew registry. You can install it using `brew`:

    ```bash
    $ brew install wabt
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Linux">

    If you are on a APT based distro (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu), you can download the `wabt` package:

    ```bash
    apt install wabt
    ```

    If using any other distro, see Building from source.

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Windows">
    You must build it from source.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Building from source

If you system does not provide prebuilt binary for WABT, it is outdated, or you want to make some modifications in it, you must build it from source manually.

For information on how to do that, visit [official README](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt).

## Installing Polygen

### Using `polygen init`

The simplest way to get started is to run the following command in your project's directory:

<Tabs groupId="packageManager" persist items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn dlx polygen@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npx polygen@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will guide you through installation progress.

### Manual installation

If the `polygen init` does not work for you, or you want to install it manually:


<Steps>

  <Step>
    In your project's main directory:

    ```package-install
    polygen @callstack/polygen-cli @callstack/polygen-metro-config @callstack/polygen-config
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Edit `package.json` of the project using `polygen`

    ```json title="package.json"
        "scripts": {
        "polygen": "polygen" // [!code ++]
      }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Create `polygen.config.mjs` file.

    <Callout type="info">
      Configuration file can have one of the following extensions: `mjs, cjs, js`
    </Callout>

    ```js title="polygen.config.js"
    import { externalModule, localModule, polygenConfig } from '@callstack/polygen-config';

    /**
     * @type {import('@callstack/polygen/config').PolygenConfig}
     */
    export default polygenConfig({
      /**
       * Output configuration
       */
      output: {
        /**
         * Directory where the output files will be stored.
         */
        // directory: 'node_modules/.polygen-out'
      },

      /**
       * Configuration for the `scan` command.
       */
      scan: {
        /**
         * List of paths to scan for modules.
         *
         * Each item is a glob pattern that can use wildcards, or be used
         * to ignore specific element by prefixing it by `!`.
         */
        // paths: [
        //     "src/**/*.wasm",
        // ]
      },

      /**
       * List of modules to be used in the project.
       *
       * Each module can be individually configured, by passing options object as a second
       * argument (or 3rd, for external modules).
       */
      modules: [
        // localModule('src/wasm/module.wasm')
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
