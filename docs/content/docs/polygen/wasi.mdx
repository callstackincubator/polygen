## What is WASI?

Since WebAssembly modules are strictly isolated from the host environment, they cannot access the file system, network, or any other system resources directly.
This greatly limits the capabilities of the modules, as everything needs to be provided by the embedder/host.
While great for security, it also makes it hard to use WebAssembly modules for many use cases.

Each programming language has its own standard library that allows the programmer to communicate with the system,
for example to open a file or perform a network request.

However, when compiling to WebAssembly, these programming languages and standard libraries need the knowledge on how to
communicate with the system beforehand, so that the original code can be seamlessly compiled to WebAssembly.

This is where WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) comes in. It is an abstract interface (or a contract if you will)
that specifies how to communicate with the system. You can think of it as a standard library for WebAssembly.

## WASI support in Polygen

Polygen does not come with WebAssembly System Interface implementation yet.

However, since it is just an interface, you can implement the required methods yourself.

<Callout type="info">
  Polygen will provide support for WASI in the future releases.
